                                    Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics.
                                    Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding,
                                    make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or
                                    glue language to connect existing components together.

                                    C is a general-purpose, procedural computer programming language supporting structured programming, 
                                    lexical variable scope, and recursion, with a static type system. 
                                    By design, C provides constructs that map efficiently to typical machine instructions. 
                                    It has found lasting use in applications previously coded in assembly language. 
                                    Such applications include operating systems and various application software for computer architectures 
                                    that range from supercomputers to PLCs and embedded systems.

                                    JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex features on web pages 
                                    — every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static information for you to look at 
                                    — displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, etc. 
                                    — you can bet that JavaScript is probably involved.

                                    HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the code that is used to structure a web page and its content. 
                                    For example, content could be structured within a set of paragraphs, a list of bulleted points, 
                                    or using images and data tables. As the title suggests, this article will give you a basic understanding of HTML and its functions.

                                    Haskell is a general-purpose, statically-typed, purely functional programming language with 
                                    type inference and lazy evaluation. Designed for teaching, research and industrial application, 
                                    Haskell has pioneered a number of advanced programming language features such as type classes, 
                                    which enable type-safe operator overloading. Haskell's main implementation is the Glasgow Haskell Compiler (GHC). 
                                    It is named after logician Haskell Curry.

                                President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia has made a final decision to invade Ukraine. 
                                “We have reason to believe the Russian forces are planning to, intend to, attack Ukraine in the coming week, in the coming days,” 
                                Mr. Biden said in the Roosevelt Room at the White House. “We believe that they will target Ukraine’s capital Kyiv, a city of 2.8 million innocent people.”

                                And for now, the threat remains contingent on invasion, even as Russia has massed between 169,000 and 
                                190,000 personnel in and around Ukraine, including Russian-led forces in breakaway regions in eastern Ukraine.
